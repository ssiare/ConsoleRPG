# ConsoleRPG

This is my first project I have ever made. It's a basic RPG game using a console and C#, it has the most basic functions implemented like a shop and enemies to battle.

# New features

I'd like to add in the future things like special items with unique stats or effects, more enemy variety, a new level up system and some inventory management.
